# Connection Manager

The Connection Manager works with the Registrar to keep connections across libp2p within acceptable ranges, which can be configured. By default Connection Manager will monitor:
- The total number of open connections
- The latency/delay of the event loop

If Metrics are enabled for libp2p, see [./CONFIGURATION.md#configuring-metrics](./CONFIGURATION.md#configuring-metrics) on how to configure metrics, the Connection Manager can be used to prune connections when certain limits are exceeded.

The following is a list of available options for setting limits for the Connection Manager to enforce.

## Options
- `maxConnections`: the maximum number of connections libp2p is willing to have before it starts disconnecting. Defaults to `Infinity`
- `minConnections`: the minimum number of connections below which libp2p not activate preemptive disconnections. Defaults to `0`.
- `maxData`: sets the maximum data — in bytes per second -  (sent and received) this node is willing to endure before it starts disconnecting peers. Defaults to `Infinity`.
- `maxSentData`: sets the maximum sent data — in bytes per second -  this node is willing to endure before it starts disconnecting peers. Defaults to `Infinity`.
- `maxReceivedData`: sets the maximum received data — in bytes per second -  this node is willing to endure before it starts disconnecting peers. Defaults to `Infinity`.
- `maxEventLoopDelay`: sets the maximum event loop delay (measured in milliseconds) this node is willing to endure before it starts disconnecting peers. Defaults to `Infinity`.
- `pollInterval`: sets the poll interval (in milliseconds) for assessing the current state and determining if this peer needs to force a disconnect. Defaults to `2000` (2 seconds).
- `movingAverageInterval`: the interval used to calculate moving averages (in milliseconds). Defaults to `60000` (1 minute). This must be an available interval configured in `Metrics`
- `defaultPeerValue`: number between 0 and 1. Defaults to 1.
- `gater`: gater options.
