## Circuit Relay v2

libp2p@0.43.x ships with support for [Circuit Relay v2](https://github.com/libp2p/specs/blob/master/relay/circuit-v2.md).  This update to the spec changes the relay from being an open relay by default, and as such quite dangerous to enable, to being a limited relay with a slot reservation mechanism that is much safer.

With version 2, each relay has a limited number of slots available (default: 15) which network peers can reserve use of to transfer small amounts of data to and from other peers (default 128k) for short amounts of time (default: 2 minutes).

This allows network nodes to act as intermediaries between nodes that may otherwise not be able to communicate due to a lack of compatible transports.

To simplify configuration, the client and server parts of the relay have been split apart to make it easier to configure your node as a client and/or a server.

**Before**

```js
import { createLibp2p } from 'libp2p'

const node = await createLibp2p({
  // ... other options
  addresses: {
    listen: {
      '/ip4/123.123.123.123/p2p/QmRelay/p2p-circuit' // optionally configure a static relay
    }
  },
  relay: {
    enabled: true, // enable client portion of relay

    autoRelay: {
      enabled: true, // enable automatically finding network relays
      maxListeners: 2 // limit number of network relays to use
    }

    hop: {
      enabled: true, // enable server portion of relay
      active: true  // dial other nodes on the incoming relay client's behalf
    },

    advertise: {
      enabled: true, // advertise the relay server on this node
      bootDelay: 15 * 60 * 1000,  // how long to wait after startup before advertising
      ttl: 30 * 60 * 1000 // how often to re-advertise
    }
  }
})
```

**After**

```js
import { createLibp2p } from 'libp2p'
import { circuitRelayClient, circuitRelayServer } from 'libp2p/circuit-relay'

const node = await createLibp2p({
  // ... other options
  addresses: {
    listen: {
      '/ip4/123.123.123.123/p2p/QmRelay/p2p-circuit' // optionally configure a static relay
    }
  },
  transports: [
    circuitRelayClient({ // enable client portion of relay
      discoverRelays: 1 // find this number of network relays (default: 0)
    })
  ],
  relay: circuitRelayServer({ // enable server portion of relay
    advertise: {
      bootDelay: 15 * 60 * 1000 // how long to wait after startup before re-advertising
    }
  })
})
```

Please see the [Setup with Relay](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p/blob/master/doc/CONFIGURATION.md#setup-with-relay) section of the configuration for a full breakdown of all the options.
