# libp2p in the browser

This example leverages the [vite bundler](https://vitejs.dev/) to compile and serve the libp2p code in the browser. You can use other bundlers such as Webpack, but we will not be covering them here.

## Setup

In order to run the example:

- Install dependencey at the root of the js-libp2p repository (if not already done),
- then, install the dependencies from same directory as this README:

```
npm install
npm run build
cd ./examples/libp2p-in-the-browser
npm install
```

## Running the examples

Start by running the vite server:

```
npm start
```

The output should look something like this:

```log
$ npm start

> libp2p-in-browser@1.0.0 start
> vite index.html

Server running at http://localhost:1234
âœ¨  Built in 1000ms.
```

This will compile the code and start a server listening on port [http://localhost:1234](http://localhost:1234). Now open your browser to `http://localhost:1234`. You should see a log of your node's Peer ID, the discovered peers from the Bootstrap module, and connections to those peers as they are created.

Now, if you open a second browser tab to `http://localhost:1234`, you should discover your node from the previous tab.

**Note**: In the example we assign libp2p to `window.libp2p`, in case you would like to play around with the API directly in the browser. You can of course make changes to `index.js` and vite will automatically rebuild and reload the browser tabs.
